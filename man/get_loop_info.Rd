\description{
Associator of loop to character association
<<<<<<< HEAD
Volatile, likely won't live for long
as Nick and I transition to moving the primary 
loop driver out of JunctionDetection.R
=======
Relevant Features:
Loop Count, how many loops are found in the letter
Loop Major, length of farthest line that can be drawn inside of a loop
Loop Minor, length of the perpindcular bisector of the loop major.
! I've removed loop minor / loop major features due to instability during testing.
The outliers were frequent enough to deem my implementation unreliable for modeling.
I need additional help in some of the syntactical challenges I've experienced with those features..
